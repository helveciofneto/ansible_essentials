# 2. Basic Concepts

  - ## 2.1 What Is Ansible?
    **Ansible** is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool. It uses no agents (like Chef or Puppet) and requires no additional custom security infrastructure - if you can connect to a Unix/Linux machine via SSH or connect to a Windows host via WinRM, you are good to go!

    Ansible uses a very simple language (**YAML**, in the form of Ansible Playbooks) that allow you to describe your automation jobs in a way that approaches plain English. It also uses simple text files called **inventory files** to store different information about how to connect to different servers.

    ***NOTE:** The following are just introductory topics. Please go to the `References` section at the bottom of this file for a more in-depth view of each one.*

    ---

  - ## 2.2 YAML
    YAML (a recursive acronym for "YAML Ain't Markup Language") is a language commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted. In Ansible, YAML is the building block for Ansible playbooks.

    Here is a sample YAML declaration:
    ```YAML
    ---
    # An employee record
    name: Martin D'vloper
    job: Developer
    skill: Elite
    employed: True
    foods:
    - Apple
    - Orange
    - Strawberry
    - Mango
    languages:
      perl: Elite
      python: Elite
      pascal: Lame
    education: |
      4 GCSEs
      3 A-Levels
      BSc in the Internet of Things
    ```

    ---
    ***NOTE:** In YAML, indentation is critical. In fact, it's mandatory! Items indented to the right are children of the left-indented items above them.*

    *Please refer to the [YAML Syntax Reference](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html) page for more information*.

    ---


  - ## 2.3 JSON
    JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a language-independent, human-readable data format optimized for data exchange. It is structured as key/value pairs and is used in several parts of Ansible such as the inventory, playbook modules, variables, etc.

    This is a sample JSON structure:
    ```JSON
    {
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Smith",
      "isAlive": true,
      "age": 27,
      "address": {
        "streetAddress": "21 2nd Street",
        "city": "New York",
        "state": "NY",
        "postalCode": "10021-3100"
      },
      "phoneNumbers": [
        {
          "type": "home",
          "number": "212 555-1234"
        },
        {
          "type": "office",
          "number": "646 555-4567"
        }
      ],
      "children": [],
      "spouse": null
    }
    ```

    ---
    ***NOTE:** Within Ansible, and throughout this course, you may often hear "keys" being referred to as "fields." The two terms are interchangeable for our purposes.*

    *For more in-depth information on JSON's syntax, go to the [Mozilla Developer Network's JSON Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON) page.*

    ---

  - ## 2.4 Jinja
    Jinja is a web template engine for the Python programming language (which is one of the languages Ansible was written in). In Ansible, it can be used inside playbooks to access variables and add logic to data being manipulated.

    ---
    ***NOTE:** Ansible uses Jinja version 2, so you will hear many references to **Jinja2** both in this course, in the official Ansible documentation and throughout the internet. For our purposes, **Jinja** and **Jinja2** are the same thing.*

    ---

    Follow some examples of how a Jinja2 filter works:

    ```YAML
    #Variables declaration.
    vars:
      testvar1: "SOME UPPERCASE TEXT"
      testvar2: "some lowercase text"
      test_condition: true

    #This prints the unchanged value of testvar1:
    - name: "Print variable as is"
      debug:
        msg: '{{ testvar1 }}'

    #This prints testvar1 with lower case characters.
    #The original text inside the variable is NOT changed!
    - name: "Print variable in lowercase"
      debug:
        msg: '{{ testvar1 | lower }}'

    #This prints testvar1 if test_condition is true.
    #Otherwise, print testvar2.
    - name: "Print variable if condition is true"
      debug:
        msg: '{{ testvar1 if test_condition == true else testvar2 }}'

    #This is another way of writing the same test as above.
    - name: "Print variable if condition is true"
      debug:
        msg: '{% if test_condition = true %}{{ testvar1 }}{% else %}{{ testvar2 }}{% endif %}'
    ```


  - ## 2.5 Ansible Inventory
    The Ansible Inventory is a text file (either in INI, YAML or JSON) that is used as the source of information on how to connect to a given host. All Ansible modules and playbooks run against an inventory file.

    ---
    ***NOTE:** You can add hosts to an execution on the fly, and it is also possible to use scripts that build the inventory data at runtime (i.e. to run a playbook against transient cloud instances). These are, however, advanced topics that will not be covered in this course.*

    ---

    The inventory examples below are the ones we will be using during this course and are equivalent in scope:

      - INI:
        ```INI
        [linux]
        linuxserver01 ansible_host=192.168.35.21
        linuxserver02 ansible_host=192.168.35.22

        [windows]
        windowsserver01 ansible_host=192.168.35.31

        [linux:vars]
        ansible_user=vagrant
        ansible_ssh_common_args="-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -i ~/.ssh/ansible_ssh_key"
        os=linux

        [windows:vars]
        ansible_user=vagrant
        ansible_password=vagrant
        ansible_connection=psrp
        ansible_psrp_cert_validation=ignore
        os=windows
        ```

      - YAML:
        ```YAML
        linux:
          hosts:
            linuxserver01:
              ansible_host: 192.168.35.21
            linuxserver02:
              ansible_host: 192.168.35.22
          vars:
            ansible_user: "vagrant"
            ansible_ssh_common_args: "-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -i ~/.ssh/ansible_ssh_key"
            os: "linux"
        windows:
          hosts:
            windowsserver01:
              ansible_host: 192.168.35.31
          vars:
            ansible_user: "vagrant"
            ansible_password: "vagrant"
            ansible_connection: "psrp"
            ansible_psrp_cert_validation: "ignore"
            os: "windows"
        ```

      - JSON:
        ```JSON
        {
          "linux": {
            "hosts": {
              "linuxserver01": {
                "ansible_host": "192.168.35.21"
              },
              "linuxserver02": {
                "ansible_host": "192.168.35.22"
              }
            },
            "vars": {
              "ansible_user": "vagrant",
              "ansible_ssh_common_args": "-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -i ~/.ssh/ansible_ssh_key",
              "os": "linux"
            }
          },
          "windows": {
            "hosts": {
              "windowsserver01": {
                "ansible_host": "192.168.35.31"
              }
            },
            "vars": {
              "ansible_user": "vagrant",
              "ansible_password": "vagrant",
              "ansible_connection": "psrp",
              "ansible_psrp_cert_validation": "ignore",
              "os": "windows"
            }
          }
        }
        ```

  - ## 2.6 Basic Ansible Shell Commands
    - ### 2.6.1 `ansible`
      This is the basic command we use to run single modules, like `ping`:
      ```shell
      $ ansible -i ~/ansible/custom_inventory.json -m ping linuxserver01
      ```
      Output:
      ```
      linuxserver01 | SUCCESS => {
          "changed": false,
          "ping": "pong"
      }
      $
      ```

    - ### 2.6.2 `ansible-inventory`
      This command is a good way to validate if an inventory file was constructed correctly. If there are any parsing or structure errors, the command will fail.
      ```shell
      $ ansible-inventory --list -i ansible/custom_inventory.yml
      ```
      Output:
      ```
      {
          "_meta": {
              "hostvars": {
                  "linuxserver01": {
                      "ansible_host": "192.168.35.21",
                      "ansible_ssh_common_args": "-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -i ~/.ssh/ansible_ssh_key",
                      "ansible_user": "vagrant",
                      "os": "linux"
                  },
                  "linuxserver02": {
                      "ansible_host": "192.168.35.22",
                      "ansible_ssh_common_args": "-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -i ~/.ssh/ansible_ssh_key",
                      "ansible_user": "vagrant",
                      "os": "linux"
                  },
                  "windowsserver01": {
                      "ansible_connection": "psrp",
                      "ansible_host": "192.168.35.31",
                      "ansible_password": "vagrant",
                      "ansible_psrp_cert_validation": "ignore",
                      "ansible_user": "vagrant",
                      "os": "windows"
                  }
              }
          },
          "all": {
              "children": [
                  "linux",
                  "ungrouped",
                  "windows"
              ]
          },
          "linux": {
              "hosts": [
                  "linuxserver01",
                  "linuxserver02"
              ]
          },
          "ungrouped": {},
          "windows": {
              "hosts": [
                  "windowsserver01"
              ]
          }
      }
      $
      ```
      Run `ansible-inventory -h` for further information on this command.

    - ### 2.6.3 `ansible-playbook`
      This is the command we use to run Ansible playbooks:
      ```shell
      ansible-playbook -i ~/ansible/custom_inventory.json -e 'affected_host=linuxserver*' ~/ansible/playbooks/ping.yml
      ```
      In the example above, note that the `-e` (extra vars) parameter was used to inform which servers to run the playbook on. The `affected_host` is the name of variable created in the playbook that receives this information. We'll get to that in more detail when we run our first playbook.

      Example output:
      ```
      PLAY [Ping Module] *******************************************************************************************

      TASK [Run Ping Module] ***************************************************************************************
      ok: [linuxserver01]
      ok: [linuxserver02]

      TASK [Ping Module Output] ************************************************************************************
      ok: [linuxserver01] => {
          "msg": {
              "changed": false,
              "failed": false,
              "ping": "pong"
          }
      }
      ok: [linuxserver02] => {
          "msg": {
              "changed": false,
              "failed": false,
              "ping": "pong"
          }
      }

      PLAY RECAP ***************************************************************************************************
      linuxserver01              : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0
      linuxserver02              : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0
      ```

    - ### 2.6.4 `ansible-doc`
      The `ansible-doc` command is used to display information on all installed modules, plugins and other elements.

      The following is an excerpt of the `ansible-doc ansible.builtin.copy` command, which displays details on how to use the `ansible.builtin.copy` module:
      ```
      ANSIBLE.BUILTIN.COPY    (/home/vagrant/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ansible/modules/copy.py)

              The `copy' module copies a file from the local or remote machine to a location on the remote machine. Use the [ansible.builtin.fetch] module to copy files from remote
              locations to the local box. If you need variable interpolation in copied files, use the [ansible.builtin.template] module. Using a variable in the `content' field will
              result in unpredictable output. For Windows targets, use the [ansible.windows.win_copy] module instead.

        * note: This module has a corresponding action plugin.

      OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

      - attributes
              The attributes the resulting file or directory should have.
              To get supported flags look at the man page for `chattr' on the target system.
              This string should contain the attributes in the same order as the one displayed by `lsattr'.
              The `=' operator is assumed as default, otherwise `+' or `-' operators need to be included in the string.
              (Aliases: attr)[Default: (null)]
              type: str
              version_added: 2.3
              version_added_collection: ansible.builtin

      - backup
              Create a backup file including the timestamp information so you can get the original file back if you somehow clobbered it incorrectly.
              [Default: False]
              type: bool
              version_added: 0.7
              version_added_collection: ansible.builtin

      - checksum
              SHA1 checksum of the file being transferred.
              Used to validate that the copy of the file was successful.
              If this is not provided, ansible will use the local calculated checksum of the src file.
              [Default: (null)]
              type: str
              version_added: 2.5
              version_added_collection: ansible.builtin
      (...)
      ```
