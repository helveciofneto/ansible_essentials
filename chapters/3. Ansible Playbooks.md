# 3. Ansible Playbooks

  - ## 3.1 What Is an Ansible Playbook?
    A playbook is a YAML file that contains information on tasks that are run by Ansible against hosts selected from the inventory.

    Let's take the playbook `ansible/playbooks/get_os_info.yml` as an example:

    ```YAML
    # Play Declaration
    - name: Send OS Info Email
      hosts: 'linuxserver01'
      gather_facts: no

      tasks:
        - name: Get OS Info
          command: 'uname -a'
          changed_when: false
          register: os_info

        - name: Send Email
          mail:
            host: smtp.gmail.com
            port: 587
            username: <your GMail address>
            password: <a valid GMail App Password>  # For creating App Passwords, refer to https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en
            secure: try
            charset: utf8
            from: <your GMail address>
            to: recipient@domain.com  # Change to a valid email address.
            subject: 'OS Info - {{ inventory_hostname }}' #inventory_hostname is automatically set from the inventory.
            body: '{{ os_info }}'
    ```
    ---
    ***NOTE:** If you ever get lost when editing your playbook and wish to start over, just copy the content above into `ansible/playbooks/get_os_info.yml` and you're good to go. Alternatively, you can also refer to `ansible/playbooks/templates/get_os_info_ch3_initial.yml`.*

    ---

  - ## 3.2 Plays
    Each playbook may contain one or more plays. Each play contains one or more tasks that are run against one or more hosts from the inventory.

    In our playbook, there is one play called `Send OS Info Email` containing two tasks: `Get OS Info` and `Send Email`. It is also targeting a specific host: `linuxserver01`.

  - ## 3.3 Tasks
    Tasks are calls to Ansible modules, which are executed in order, one at a time, against all hosts matched by the pattern for that play.
    As stated earlier, this playbook has two tasks: one that calls the `command` module to run the `uname -a` command on host `linuxserver01`, and another that calls the `mail` module to send the command results via email to a specific recipient. Note that the first task is also registering the command output to a variable named `os_info`.

  - ## 3.4 Running and Improving our Playbook
    To run the playbook, type in the following command in `controlserver`:
    ```shell
    ansible-playbook -i ~/ansible/custom_inventory.json ~/ansible/playbooks/get_os_info.yml
    ```

    Output:
    ```
    PLAY [Send OS Info Email] ************************************************************************************

    TASK [Get OS Info] *******************************************************************************************
    ok: [linuxserver01]

    TASK [Send Email] ********************************************************************************************
    ok: [linuxserver01]

    PLAY RECAP ***************************************************************************************************
    linuxserver01              : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0

    [vagrant@localhost ~]$
    ```

    If all went well, you should have received an email with a JSON-like output, as follows:
    ```
    {'stderr_lines': [], 'cmd': ['uname', '-a'], 'end': '2020-06-12 21:20:03.528818', 'stdout': 'Linux localhost.localdomain 2.6.32-754.14.2.el6.x86_64 #1 SMP Tue May 14 19:35:42 UTC 2019 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux', 'changed': True, 'rc': 0, 'failed': False, 'stderr': '', 'delta': '0:00:00.002021', 'stdout_lines': ['Linux localhost.localdomain 2.6.32-754.14.2.el6.x86_64 #1 SMP Tue May 14 19:35:42 UTC 2019 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux'], 'start': '2020-06-12 21:20:03.526797'}
    ```

    From this point, let's start to explore what we can do to improve our playbook.

    ---
    ***NOTE:** In this course, we will use the default `ansible-playbook` command output, but you can also add the `-vvv` parameter to get additional information on how your Ansible playbook is running behind the scenes.*

    ---

    - ### 3.4.1 Selecting Output Fields
      In the email we received, the information we need is there, but there is a lot of unwanted clutter too! So our first adjustment will be to send only the information we need. To do that, we'll replace the `body` value of the `mail` module of our playbook from:

      ```YAML
      body: '{{ os_info }}'
      ```

      to:
      ```YAML
      body: '{{ os_info.stdout }}'
      ```

      All Ansible modules that are executed in a host will use JSON to respond to Ansible, hence the JSON-like message in the email. That complete JSON information is important for Ansible to determine if the task performed successfully, to get statistics and so on, but for our purposes, we just need the `stdout` value, which in this case is the output of the `uname -a` command.

      After making the adjustment, we can run the playbook again:
      ```shell
      ansible-playbook -i ~/ansible/custom_inventory.json ~/ansible/playbooks/get_os_info.yml
      ```

      Now the email should look better, as it brings only the information we need:
      ```
      Linux localhost.localdomain 2.6.32-754.14.2.el6.x86_64 #1 SMP Tue May 14 19:35:42 UTC 2019 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
      ```
    - ### 3.4.2 Targeting Hosts Programmatically
      Our playbook is working, but as it is, it only runs on one server (`linuxserver01`). Let's explore some of the changes we could make to the `hosts` directive to make the playbook run on more hosts:

      ```YAML
      # This will run on all hosts or groups that start with "linuxserver" in the inventory.
      hosts: 'linuxserver*'

      # This selects all members of the "linux" group in our inventory.
      hosts: 'linux'

      #This selects all hosts, which we don't want since we have a Windows server in our inventory, and the SSH and "uname -a" commands will not work on it.
      hosts: "all"

      # By using a variable, we can select whether we run on one or multiple hosts as needed for each run, without having to modify the playbook every time.
      hosts: '{{ affected_host }}'
      ```

      We will choose the last option, which is to use a variable called `affected_host` to import the list of hosts to run our playbook on. For that to work, we will need to use the `-e` (extra vars) parameter when calling the `ansible-playbook` command:

      ```shell
      ansible-playbook -i ~/ansible/custom_inventory.json -e 'affected_host="linux"' ~/ansible/playbooks/get_os_info.yml
      ```

      Output:
      ```
      PLAY [Send OS Info Email] ************************************************************************************

      TASK [Get OS Info] *******************************************************************************************
      ok: [linuxserver01]
      ok: [linuxserver02]

      TASK [Send Email] ********************************************************************************************
      ok: [linuxserver01]
      ok: [linuxserver02]

      PLAY RECAP ***************************************************************************************************
      linuxserver01              : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0
      linuxserver02              : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0

      [vagrant@localhost ~]$
      ```

    - ### 3.4.3 Adding Conditionals
      As you noticed, our playbook will not work on all of our hosts, because we have a Windows machine in our inventory. Because Windows hosts execute modules using Powershell instead of Python, we have to create a new task specifically for that Windows box, while making sure that each task runs only for the operating system it was designed for. To do that, we will use the `when` conditional. Also, we will get the information about the host's operating system that is already present in our inventory under `vars.os`:

      Before:
      ```YAML
      - name: Get OS Info
      command: 'uname -a'
      changed_when: false
      register: os_info
      ```

      After:
      ```YAML
      - name: Get OS Info - Linux  # Changed task name to reflect it's new scope.
        command: 'uname -a'
        changed_when: false
        register: os_info_linux  # Changed output variable name as we now have a Windows variant.
        when: vars.os != "windows"  # Added a condition so that it only runs on Linux hosts.

      #This is a new task for Windows hosts.
      - name: Get OS Info - Windows
        win_shell: >  # This syntax replaces new lines with a blank space, allowing us to break commands into multiple lines for readability.
          (Get-CimInstance Win32_OperatingSystem |
          Select-Object "Caption", "CSName", "Version", "OSArchitecture" |
          ConvertTo-Csv -NoTypeInformation -Delimiter ";" |
          Select-Object -Last 1).Replace('"','')
        changed_when: false
        register: os_info_windows  # Windows-specific output variable.
        when: vars.os == "windows"  # This conditional ensures it runs on Windows hosts only.
      ```
      ---
      ***NOTE:** The task `Get OS Info - Windows` required the `win_shell` module because `win_command` does not support special characters like `|` and `&`. For Linux, it's pretty much the same: if you needed to chain multiple commands after `uname -a`, for instance, you would have to use the `shell` module as well.*

      ---

      Now that we have two tasks, each with its own output variable, we'll use Jinja2 so that the email body has the correct information:

      Before:
      ```YAML
      body: '{{ os_info.stdout }}'
      ```

      After:
      ```YAML
      # Note that the "trim" filter is added at the end to properly remove
      # any leading or trailing spaces and new line characters that may exist.
      body: '{{ os_info_linux.stdout if vars.os != "windows" else os_info_windows.stdout | trim }}'
      ```

      Let's run our playbook and see what happens:
      ```shell
      ansible-playbook -i ~/ansible/custom_inventory.json -e 'affected_host="all"' ~/ansible/playbooks/get_os_info.yml
      ```
      Output:
      ```
      PLAY [Send OS Info Email] ************************************************************************************

      TASK [Get OS Info - Linux] ***********************************************************************************
      skipping: [windowsserver01]

      skipping: [linuxserver01]
      skipping: [linuxserver02]

      fatal: [windowsserver01]: FAILED! => {"msg": "cannot run the interpreter '/usr/bin/python' on the psrp connection plugin"}
      ok: [linuxserver02]

        to retry, use: --limit @/home/vagrant/ansible/playbooks/get_os_info.retry

      PLAY RECAP ***************************************************************************************************
      linuxserver01              : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0
      linuxserver02              : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0
      windowsserver01            : ok=1    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=1

      [vagrant@localhost ~]$
      ```
      Looks like the `Get OS Info - Linux` and `Get OS Info - Windows` tasks were correctly executed, and the `when` conditional seemed to work perfectly. However, the `Send Email` task has failed on the Windows host with the message `cannot run the interpreter '/usr/bin/python' on the psrp connection plugin`. What happened?

      As it turns out, we just noticed the `mail` module (which is written in Python) tried to run within the Windows host, causing the error above. In this case, because we just want to send an email, and all the information we need to deliver it is locally available in our Ansible server (that is, we have the hostname for the subject and we have the command output for the email body), we can run this task locally in `controlserver`. To achieve this, we will use the `delegate_to` directive as follows:

      Before:
      ```YAML
      - name: Send Email
        mail:
          host: smtp.gmail.com
          port: 587
          username: <your GMail address>
          password: <a valid GMail App Password>  # For creating App Passwords, refer to https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en
          secure: try
          charset: utf8
          from: <your GMail address>
          to: recipient@domain.com  # Change to a valid email address.
          subject: 'OS Info - {{ inventory_hostname }}'
          body: '{{ os_info_linux.stdout if vars.os != "windows" else os_info_windows.stdout | trim }}'
      ```

      After:
      ```YAML
      - name: Send Email
        mail:
          host: smtp.gmail.com
          port: 587
          username: <your GMail address>
          password: <a valid GMail App Password>  # For creating App Passwords, refer to https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en
          secure: try
          charset: utf8
          from: <your GMail address>
          to: recipient@domain.com  # Change to a valid email address.
          subject: 'OS Info - {{ inventory_hostname }}'
          body: '{{ os_info_linux.stdout if vars.os != "windows" else os_info_windows.stdout | trim }}'
        delegate_to: 127.0.0.1
      ```

      If we run the playbook again, the `Send Email` task should work for all servers as it's now running from `controlserver`:

      ```shell
      ansible-playbook -i ~/ansible/custom_inventory.json -e 'affected_host="all"' ~/ansible/playbooks/get_os_info.yml
      ```

      Output:
      ```
      PLAY [Send OS Info Email] ************************************************************************************

      TASK [Get OS Info - Linux] ***********************************************************************************
      skipping: [windowsserver01]

      ok: [linuxserver02]

      TASK [Get OS Info - Windows] *********************************************************************************
      skipping: [linuxserver01]
      skipping: [linuxserver02]
      ok: [windowsserver01]

      TASK [Send Email] ********************************************************************************************
      ok: [windowsserver01 -> 127.0.0.1]
      ok: [linuxserver01 -> 127.0.0.1]
      ok: [linuxserver02 -> 127.0.0.1]

      PLAY RECAP ***************************************************************************************************
      linuxserver01              : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0
      linuxserver02              : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0
      windowsserver01            : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0

      [vagrant@localhost ~]$
      ```

      Notice that now the email delivery has worked for all hosts, and the `ansible-playbook` command output indicates the task was delegated from each respective host to `127.0.0.1` in `controlserver`.

      It is good practice to ask yourself *"Does this task need to run on the target host? Can it run locally and save network and resource load instead?"* and use `delegate_to: 127.0.0.1` whenever possible. Besides sending an email, other examples include tasks that just format or manipulate variables (`set_fact`), deal with local files, connect to a URL (`uri` module), perform local calculations or date/time manipulation... the list goes on.

      ---
      ***NOTE:** It is possible to use `delegate_to` to delegate tasks to other servers, even those not in the inventory (e.g. a file server or a remote log repository), but there are some additional connectivity settings that need to be taken into account to make it work properly. Those more advanced requirements aren't covered by this course, but you can always go to this chapter's `References` for more information.*

      ---

    - ### 3.4.4 Dealing With Unreachable Hosts
      We have a playbook that supports both Windows and Linux hosts and is able to send an email with each operating system information. All is well, until one of the target hosts is down.

      To simulate that, lets's shut down `linuxserver02`. You will run the commands below in your local machine's Shell/Powershell window:

      ```shell
      $ cd servers/linuxserver02
      $ vagrant halt
      ==> default: Attempting graceful shutdown of VM...
      $
      ```

      Now, let's run our playbook in `controlserver` and see how it reacts:

      ```shell
      ansible-playbook -i ~/ansible/custom_inventory.json -e 'affected_host="all"' ~/ansible/playbooks/get_os_info.yml
      ```

      Output:
      ```
      PLAY [Send OS Info Email] ************************************************************************************

      TASK [Get OS Info - Linux] ***********************************************************************************
      skipping: [windowsserver01]
      ok: [linuxserver01]
      fatal: [linuxserver02]: UNREACHABLE! => {"changed": false, "msg": "Failed to connect to the host via ssh: ssh: connect to host 192.168.35.22 port 22: Connection timed out", "unreachable": true}

      TASK [Get OS Info - Windows] *********************************************************************************
      skipping: [linuxserver01]
      ok: [windowsserver01]

      TASK [Send Email] ********************************************************************************************
      ok: [linuxserver01 -> 127.0.0.1]
      ok: [windowsserver01 -> 127.0.0.1]
        to retry, use: --limit @/home/vagrant/ansible/playbooks/get_os_info.retry

      PLAY RECAP ***************************************************************************************************
      linuxserver01              : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0
      linuxserver02              : ok=0    changed=0    unreachable=1    failed=0
      windowsserver01            : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0

      [vagrant@localhost ~]$
      ```

      As you can see, `linuxserver02` has returned a JSON message with the `UNREACHABLE` state when running the `Get OS Info - Linux` task, and the playbook ended right there for this host. The other hosts continued execution normally.

      For Ansible, `UNREACHABLE` and `FAILED` are different states, and we need to "convert" an `UNREACHABLE` state into a `FAILED` one in order to properly handle error messages. The first adjustment we will make is to add the directive `ignore_unreachable` to our play and set it to `yes`:

      Before:
      ```YAML
      - name: Send OS Info Email
        hosts: '{{ affected_host }}'
        gather_facts: no
      ```

      After:
      ```YAML
      - name: Send OS Info Email
        hosts: '{{ affected_host }}'
        gather_facts: no
        ignore_unreachable: yes
      ```

      By adding `ignore_unreachable: yes`, we are telling the play `Send OS Info Email` that it can proceed with running subsequent tasks for a given host, even when it's not reachable. This will allow us to add further tasks to properly handle the error message.

      Now that we know the playbook will not stop when the host in unreachable, we can use the `fail` module to capture the `UNREACHABLE` state info and report an error. We do that by adding the following right above the `Send Email` task:

      ```YAML
      - name: Fail If Host Is Unreachable
        fail:
          msg: '{{ os_info_linux.msg if vars.os != "windows" else os_info_windows.msg | trim }}'
        when: ( os_info_linux is defined
                and os_info_linux.unreachable is defined
                and os_info_linux.unreachable
              )
              or
              ( os_info_windows is defined
                and os_info_windows.unreachable is defined
                and os_info_windows.unreachable
              )
      ```

      ---
      ***NOTE:** The `msg` and `when` clauses above are big, but necessary. The `UNREACHABLE` state returns a JSON message with a field called `msg` containing the reason for the connection failure. It also has a field called `unreachable`, which we are using to determine that this task only runs when the field exists and is set to `true`.*

      ---

    - ### 3.4.5 Error Handling
      We have successfuly converted an `UNREACHABLE` state into a `FAILED` one, but the errors are still left unhandled. It would be nice if, instead of simply writing the error message to the Ansible terminal, we could send an email about it too! To do this, we will use `block`, `rescue` and `always`.

      A `block` allows us to group tasks together and run them all based on a single set of conditions, while `rescue` is used to execute a group of tasks whenever a failure occurs to its related block. As the name suggests, `rescue` is used to attempt to recover a playbook from a `FAILED` state.

      We use `always` when we want to run a group of tasks regardless of what `block` or `rescue` have done. That said, `block`, `rescue` and `always` will only execute if the block's `when` clause evaluates to `true`.


      First, we will add a `block` right below the `tasks` directive, as follows:
      ```YAML
      # Play Declaration
      - name: Send OS Info Email
        hosts: '{{ affected_host }}'
        gather_facts: no
        ignore_unreachable: yes

        tasks:
          - block: # <--- Added Block.
              # Note that all tasks below need to be shifted to the right in order to be "inside" this block.
              - name: Get OS Info - Linux
                command: 'uname -a'
                changed_when: false
                register: os_info_linux
                when: vars.os != "windows"

              - name: Get OS Info - Windows
                win_shell:
                # (...)
      ```

      At the end of the playbook, we will add a `rescue` directive containing a new task to send an email in case of failure. We will also adjust the name and email subject of the existing `Send Email` task as follows:
      ```YAML
      # (...)
        - name: Send Email - Success  # Name changed to reflect scope.
          mail:
            host: smtp.gmail.com
            port: 587
            username: <your GMail address>
            password: <a valid GMail App Password>  # For creating App Passwords, refer to https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en
            secure: try
            charset: utf8
            from: <your GMail address>

            subject: 'OS Info [FAILURE] - {{ inventory_hostname }}'
            body: '{{ ansible_failed_result.msg }}'
          delegate_to: 127.0.0.1
      ```
      ---
      ***NOTE:** The `body` field in the `Send Email - Failure` task looks different. That's because we are taking advantage of a system variable called `ansible_failed_result`, which stores information about the last failure that occurred in the play. It contains a `msg` field with the last error message.*

      ---

      Now, if we run our playbook, we should get two success emails for `linuxserver01` and `windowsserver01`, and one failure email for `linuxserver02`:

      ```shell
      ansible-playbook -i ~/ansible/custom_inventory.json -e 'affected_host="all"' ~/ansible/playbooks/get_os_info.yml
      ```

      Output:
      ```

    - ### 3.4.6 Facts and Variables
      Facts are information associated to the target host, such as the hostname, IP address, connection settings, variables set in the inventory, sent by the terminal command, or set at the play level.

      The `set_fact` module is used to create variables that can be used further down within the play. For instance:

      ```YAML
      - name: Set Facts Example
        set_fact:
          test_string: "String Value"
          test_number: 15
          test_json_singleline: {"test_string": "test1", "test_number": 2}
          test_json_multiline:
            test_string: "test2"
            test_number: 5
            test_list: [ "entry_1", 2, "entry_3"]

      # Prints "String Value"
      - debug:
          msg: '{{ test_string }}'

      # Prints "test1"
      - debug:
          msg: '{{ test_json_singleline.test_string }}'

      # Prints "entry_3"
      - debug:
          msg: '{{ test_json_multiline.test_list[2] }}'

      # Calculates 15 + 5 and prints "20"
      - debug:
          msg: '{{ test_number + test_json_multiline.test_number }}'
      ```

      Going back to our `get_os_info.yml` playbook, there are a few things we can do to further optimize it: merge all calls to the `mail` module into one single place, as well as use variables for the `to:` field so we can send emails to different addresses without editing the playbook each time.

      To accomplish that, we will add an `always` directive to our existing `block`. This will ensure that we always call the same `mail` module, no matter the results.

      Our changes will be as follows:

      Before:
      ```YAML
      # (...)
        - name: Send Email - Success
          mail:
            host: smtp.gmail.com
            port: 587
            username: <your GMail address>
            password: <a valid GMail App Password>  # For creating App Passwords, refer to https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en
            secure: try
            charset: utf8
            from: <your GMail address>
            to: recipient@domain.com  # Change to a valid email address.
            subject: 'OS Info [SUCCESS] - {{ inventory_hostname }}'  # Subject updated with [SUCCESS] tag.
            body: '{{ os_info_linux.stdout if vars.os != "windows" else os_info_windows.stdout | trim }}'
          delegate_to: 127.0.0.1
      rescue:
        - name: Send Email - Failure
          mail:
            host: smtp.gmail.com
            port: 587
            username: <your GMail address>
            password: <a valid GMail App Password>  # For creating App Passwords, refer to https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en
            secure: try
            charset: utf8
            from: <your GMail address>
            to: recipient@domain.com  # Change to a valid email address.
            subject: 'OS Info [FAILURE] - {{ inventory_hostname }}'
            body: '{{ ansible_failed_result.msg }}'
          delegate_to: 127.0.0.1
      ```

      After:
      ```YAML
        # (...)
        # "Send Email - Success" was replaced with a simple "set_fact".
        # -------------------------------------
        - name: Set Email Variables - Success
          set_fact:
            email_tag: "[SUCCESS]"
            email_body: '{{ os_info_linux.stdout if vars.os != "windows" else os_info_windows.stdout | trim }}'
          delegate_to: 127.0.0.1
          # -------------------------------------
      rescue:
        # "rescue" block was also changed to a simple "set_fact".
        # -------------------------------------
        - name: Set Email Variables - Failure
          set_fact:
            email_tag: "[FAILURE]"
            email_body: '{{ ansible_failed_result.msg }}'
          delegate_to: 127.0.0.1
          # -------------------------------------
      always:
        # Added "always" block with a generic "Send Email" task.
        # This task will run on both success and failure situations.
        # -------------------------------------
        - name: Send Email
          mail:
            host: smtp.gmail.com
            port: 587
            username: <your GMail address>
            password: <a valid GMail App Password>  # For creating App Passwords, refer to https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en
            secure: try
            charset: utf8
            from: <your GMail address>
            to: '{{ email_to | default("recipient@domain.com") }}'  # Change to a valid email address.
            subject: 'OS Info {{ email_tag }} - {{ inventory_hostname }}'
            body: '{{ email_body }}'
          delegate_to: 127.0.0.1
          # -------------------------------------
      ```

    - ### 3.4.7 Improved Playbook
      After applying the concepts we learned so far to improve our playbook, it should look like this:

      ```YAML
      # Play Declaration

              - name: Fail If Host Is Unreachable
                fail:
                  msg: '{{ os_info_linux.msg if vars.os != "windows" else os_info_windows.msg | trim }}'
                when: ( os_info_linux is defined
                        and os_info_linux.unreachable is defined
                        and os_info_linux.unreachable
                      )
                      or
                      ( os_info_windows is defined

              - name: Set Email Variables - Success
                set_fact:
                  email_tag: "[SUCCESS]"
                  email_body: '{{ os_info_linux.stdout if vars.os != "windows" else os_info_windows.stdout | trim }}'

      ```

      ---
      ***NOTE:** There are several other improvements that can be made to this playbook, some of which require a bit more understanding of additional Ansible concepts such as modules, roles and running scripts. Some of these concepts will be covered in the chapters that follow. Feel free to get back to this playbook and make further improvements to it as you progress in your learning journey!*

      ---

  - ### 3.5 The `become` Directive
    The `become`directive is used when you want to run a task as another user. You may need to run a task as the root user in order to start or stop a service, or to install software packages, for instance.

    It is possible to run `sudo` commands directly in the `shell` and `raw` modules (e.g. `shell: sudo whoami`), but this is not a good practice, especially if you manage a heterogenous inventory comprise of multiple OS flavors and different authentication methods. With `become`, each host in the inventory can have it's pre-confgured settings available in a transparent way.

    The following playbook is an example of how to use the `become` directive:
    ```YAML
    - name: Become
      hosts: '{{ affected_host }}'
      gather_facts: no
      ignore_unreachable: yes

      tasks:
        - name: Create File Without Become
          tempfile:
            state: file
            prefix: ansible.
            suffix: .no_become
          register: tempfile_no_become

        - name: Print File Info (No Become)
          debug:
            msg: '{{ tempfile_no_become }}'

        - name: Create File Using Become
          tempfile:
            state: file
            prefix: ansible.
            suffix: .using_become
          register: tempfile_using_become
          become: yes
          become_method: sudo
          become_user: root  # Not really required for root.

        - name: Print File Info (Using Become)
          debug:
            msg: '{{ tempfile_using_become }}'
    ```
    ---
    ***NOTE:** You can also find this playbook at `ansible/playbooks/become.yml`*.
