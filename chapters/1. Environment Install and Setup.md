# 1. Environment Install and Setup
For installing our lab environment upon which this course is based, follow the step-by-step instructions below.
  - ## 1.1 Install Visual Studio Code
    - Website: https://code.visualstudio.com/
    - ### 1.1.1 VSCode Setup
      - Press `F1` and choose `Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)`;
      - Insert the following items the Settings file:
        ```JSON
        {
          "editor.tabSize": 2,
          "files.trimTrailingWhitespace": true,
          "files.eol": "\n",
          "files.insertFinalNewline": true,
        }
        ```
  - ## 1.2 Install Virtualbox
    - Website: https://www.virtualbox.org/
    - Recommended version is `6.1.26`. If you have an older version installed, consider upgrading it.
    ---
    ***IMPORTANT:** For Windows, ensure Virtualbox is installed in a path without special characters (e.g. use `C:\virtualbox`).*

    ---
  - ## 1.3 Install Vagrant
    - Website: https://www.vagrantup.com/
    - Recommended install version is `2.2.18`.
    - After the install is complete, run `vagrant --version` to confirm Vagrant was installed correctly:
      ```shell
      $ vagrant --version
      Vagrant 2.2.18
      $
      ```
    - ### 1.3.1 Vagrant Virtualbox Guest Additions Plugin Setup
      - **Required install version is `0.30.0`**.
      - After Vagrant is installed, run `vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest --plugin-version 0.30.0` in a Shell/Powershell prompt:
        ```shell
        $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
        Installing the 'vagrant-vbguest' plugin. This can take a few minutes...
        Installed the plugin 'vagrant-vbguest (0.30.0)'!
        $
        ```
    ---
    ***NOTE:** On Windows, it may be necessary to reboot the system at this point.*

    ---
  - ## 1.4 Lab Environment Setup
    Our lab environment consists of four VMs that are automatically configured and provisioned using Vagrant:

    - `controlserver`: A CentOS 7 host with Ansible 2.7.11 already installed and configured. This will be the host from which we'll run all Ansible-related commands.

    - `linuxserver01` and `linuxserver02`: These are hosts running CentOS 7 as well and will be used as targets for our Linux-related tasks.

    - `windowsserver01`: This is a Windows Server Standard 2016 (Evaluation), and will be the target of Ansible's Windows-related tasks.

    Under normal conditions, we will we will only need log into `controlserver` throughout this course.
    - ### 1.4.1 Downloading the Source Code from GitHub

      - In this repository's Main page (https://github.com/helveciofneto/ansible_essentials), click the green dropdown `Code` button in the upper-right corner, choose `Download ZIP` and save/unpack the ZIP file in the path of your choice.

      ---
      ***NOTE:** The downloaded file may be called `ansible_essentials-main.zip`. It is recommended that you rename the unpacked directory to just `ansible_essentials`.*

      ---

    - ### 1.4.2 Running/Resetting the Lab Environment

      - To automatically provision all servers for our lab, run `servers/servers_init.sh` (Mac/Linux) or `servers/servers_init.ps1` (Windows).

      - To automatically stop all running servers without deleting them, run `servers\servers_stop.sh` (Mac/Linux) or `servers\servers_stop.ps1` (Windows).

      - To reset the lab and stop/remove all VMs from your system, run `servers/servers_reset.sh` (Mac/Linux) or `servers\servers_reset.ps1` (Windows).
      <br>
      <br>

        ---
        ***NOTE:** Both the `servers_init` and `servers_reset` commands may take several minutes to complete!*

        ---
        <br>
        <br>

      - If you ever need to provision and/or start a specific VM, you can go to its respective directory and run the commands below:

        ```shell
        $ cd ~/ansible_essentials/servers/controlserver
        $ vagrant up

        $ cd ~/ansible_essentials/servers/linuxserver01
        $ vagrant up

        $ cd ~/ansible_essentials/servers/linuxserver02
        $ vagrant up

        $ cd ~/ansible_essentials/servers/windowsserver01
        $ vagrant up

        ```
      - Likewise, to stop a specific VM, you may go to its respective directory and run the commands below:
        ```shell
        $ cd ~/ansible_essentials/servers/controlserver
        $ vagrant halt

        $ cd ~/ansible_essentials/servers/linuxserver01
        $ vagrant halt

        $ cd ~/ansible_essentials/servers/linuxserver02
        $ vagrant halt

        $ cd ~/ansible_essentials/servers/windowsserver01
        $ vagrant halt
        ```
      - To permanently delete a VM, go to its respective directory and run the commands below:
        ```shell
        $ cd ~/ansible_essentials/servers/controlserver
        $ vagrant destroy -f

        $ cd ~/ansible_essentials/servers/linuxserver01
        $ vagrant destroy -f

        $ cd ~/ansible_essentials/servers/linuxserver02
        $ vagrant destroy -f

        $ cd ~/ansible_essentials/servers/windowsserver01
        $ vagrant destroy -f
        ```

        ---
        ***NOTE:** Your path leading to the `ansible_essentials/servers` directory may be different based on your operating system and where you downloaded/unpacked the ZIP file.*

        ---

    - ### 1.4.3 Validating your Lab Environment
      - Connect to `controlserver` using `vagrant ssh`:
        ```shell
        $ cd ~/ansible_essentials/servers/controlserver
        $ vagrant ssh
        ```
      - Once connected to `controlserver`, run the following `ansible` commands to validate connectivity to the other servers:
        ```shell
        $ ansible -i ~/ansible/custom_inventory.json -m ping linux

        $ ansible -i ~/ansible/custom_inventory.json -m win_ping windows
        ```
      - If everything works as expected, you should get an output like the one below, which means we are ready to move on to the next chapter:
        ```shell
        [vagrant@localhost ~]$ ansible -i ~/ansible/custom_inventory.json -m ping linux
        linuxserver01 | SUCCESS => {
            "changed": false,
            "ping": "pong"
        }
        linuxserver02 | SUCCESS => {
            "changed": false,
            "ping": "pong"
        }
        [vagrant@localhost ~]$ ansible -i ~/ansible/custom_inventory.json -m win_ping windows
        windowsserver01 | SUCCESS => {
            "changed": false,
            "ping": "pong"
        }
        [vagrant@localhost ~]$
        ```

    ---
    ***NOTE:** From this point, all terminal commands in this course will be run from within `controlserver` and assume you have already connected to it using `vagrant ssh`, unless specifically stated otherwise.*
