# 5. Ansible Roles

  - ## 5.1 What Are Ansible Roles?
    An Ansible role is a pre-defined way to organize and automatically load variables, tasks and other settings. Grouping playbooks by roles allows for more modular solutions and eases sharing code with other users.

  - ## 5.2 Ansible Roles Structure
    The following is sample directory structure for three roles, called `common`, `linux` and `windows`:
    ```
    ansible +
            |
            + playbooks +
                        |
                        + roles +
                                |
                                + common  +
                                |         |
                                |         + tasks
                                |         + handlers
                                |         + files
                                |         + templates
                                |         + vars
                                |         + defaults
                                |         + meta
                                |
                                |
                                + linux   +
                                |         |
                                |         + tasks
                                |         + defaults
                                |         + meta
                                |
                                |
                                + windows +
                                          |
                                          + tasks
                                          + defaults
    ```
    ---
    ***NOTE:** Any of the roles' internal directories can be omitted if empty, but at least one is required. The `roles` main directory cannot have another name and must be located right longside its calling playbooks.*

    ---

    In this chapter, we will focus on using two directories:
    - `defaults`: This is where we'll set and store default variable values for each role;

    - `tasks`: This is where the playbooks containing the tasks for our role will be located;

  - ## 5.3 Analyzing an Ansible Role Setup

    To have a better understanding of how Ansible roles work, we'll analyze a solution that calls different scripts and send emails using different addresses based on each host's operating system.

    - ### 5.3.1 Roles' Files and Structure

      In our solution, we have three roles: `linux`, `windows` and `common`. Let's take a look at each role in more detail.

      - ### `linux`:

        This role is used to collect system information and export the results to be sent via email. It has two files: `linux/defaults/main.yml` where all fixed values are declared, and `linux/tasks/main.yml`, where the Linux-specific tasks are located and variables are updated with the commands results.

        - Role structure:
          ```
          roles/
            linux/
              defaults/
                main.yml
              tasks/
                main.yml
          ```

        - Files:
          - `ansible/playbooks/roles/linux/defaults/main.yml`:
            ```YAML
            linux:
              email:
                from: '<your GMail address>'
                to: 'recipient@domain.com' # Change to a valid email address.
                subject: 'Linux Results - {{ inventory_hostname }}'
            ```

          - `ansible/playbooks/roles/linux/tasks/main.yml`:
            ```YAML
            - name: Get OS Info
              shell: uname -a && /bin/bash --version
              changed_when: false
              register: os_info

            - name: Get Memory Usage
              script: ../scripts/linux/get_memory_pct.sh
              register: memory_pct

            - name: Save Results To Email Body
              set_fact:
                  email:
                    from: '{{ linux.email.from }}'
                    to: '{{ linux.email.to }}'
                    subject: '{{ linux.email.subject }}'
                    body: |
                      {{ linux.email.subject }}:
                      {{ os_info.stdout }}
                      {{ memory_pct.stdout }}
            ```

      - ### `windows`:

        The `windows` role has an identical structure as the `linux` one. The only difference is that is has Windows-specific tasks and variables.

        - Role structure:
          ```
          roles/
            windows/
              defaults/
                main.yml
              tasks/
                main.yml
          ```

        - Files:
          - `ansible/playbooks/roles/windows/defaults/main.yml`:
            ```YAML
            windows:
              email:
                from: '<your GMail address>'
                to: 'recipient@domain.com' # Change to a valid email address.
                subject: 'Windows Results - {{ inventory_hostname }}'
            ```

          - `ansible/playbooks/roles/windows/tasks/main.yml`:
            ```YAML
            - name: Get Powershell Version
              win_shell: $PSVersionTable
              changed_when: false
              register: powershell_version

            - name: Get Memory Usage
              script: ../scripts/windows/get_memory_pct.ps1
              register: memory_pct

            - name: Save Results To Email Body
              set_fact:
                  email:
                    from: '{{ windows.email.from }}'
                    to: '{{ windows.email.to }}'
                    subject: '{{ windows.email.subject }}'
                    body: |
                      {{ windows.email.subject }}:
                      {{ powershell_version.stdout }}
                      {{ memory_pct.stdout }}
            ```

      - ### `common`:
        This role sets default variables for the email server, host, security mode and character set in `ansible/roles/defaults/send_email.yml`, and then runs the `mail` module using the email subject, body and from/to addresses set by the other roles in `ansible/roles/tasks/send_email.yml`.

        - Role structure:
          ```
          roles/
            common/
              defaults/
                send_email.yml
              tasks/
                send_email.yml
          ```
        - Files:
          - `ansible/playbooks/roles/common/defaults/send_email.yml`:
            ```YAML
            common:
              email:
                host: smtp.gmail.com
                port: 587
                username: <your GMail address>
                password: <a valid GMail App Password>  # For creating App Passwords, refer to https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en
                secure: try
                charset: utf8
            ```

          - `ansible/playbooks/roles/common/tasks/send_email.yml`:
            ```YAML
            - name: Send Email
              mail:
                host: '{{ common.email.host }}'
                port: '{{ common.email.port }}'
                secure: '{{ common.email.secure }}'
                charset: '{{ common.email.charset }}'
                from: '{{ email.from }}'
                to: '{{ email.to }}'
                subject: '{{ email.subject }}'
                body: '{{ email.body }}'
              delegate_to: 127.0.0.1
            ```

    - ### 5.3.2 Variables and Scope
      The following is a description of the variables of each role and the scope to which they're available:

      ```YAML
      - playbooks/ansible_role.yml
          # This is a system variable and is available to all playbooks and roles. It contains the name of the current host.
          inventory_hostame

      #--------------------------------
      - roles/linux:
          # Default values set when starting the role.
          # These variables are only available within the `linux` role.
          linux.email.from
          linux.email.to
          linux.email.subject

          # Runtime variables that are set when running the `set_fact` module.
          # These variables are available to the caller playbook as well as to other roles that are called after this one.
          email.from
          email.to
          email.subject
          email.body

      #--------------------------------
      - roles/windows:
          # Default values set when starting the role.
          # These variables are only available within the `windows` role.
          windows.email.from
          windows.email.to
          windows.email.subject

          # Runtime variables that are set when running the `set_fact` module.
          # These variables are available to the caller playbook as well as to other roles that are called after this one.
          email.from
          email.to
          email.subject
          email.body

      #--------------------------------
      - roles/common:
          # Default values set when starting the role.
          # These variables are only used within the `common` role.
          common.email.host
          common.email.port
          common.email.secure
          common.email.charset

          # Runtime variables that are set when running the `set_fact` module.
          # These variables are available to the caller playbook as well as to other roles that are called after this one.
          # The variables below are made available by either the `linux` or `windows` role and is used to set the contents of the email.
          email.from
          email.to
          email.subject
          email.body
      ```

      As you may have noticed, all three roles share a set of variables (`from`, `to`, `subject` and `body`) so that they can share the email data. To share variables from one role to another, they are using the `set_fact` module. Variables in `defaults` are not available to the caller playbook or any other roles.

    - ### 5.3.3 Running Ansible Roles
      To run an Ansible role, you use the `include_role` module in a caller playbook.

      Our caller playbook, `ansible/playbooks/ansible_roles.yml`, looks as follows:
      ```YAML
      # Play Declaration
      - name: Ansible Roles
        hosts: '{{ affected_host }}'
        gather_facts: no

        tasks:
          - name: Call Linux Role
            include_role:
              name: linux
            when: vars.os == "linux"

          - name: Call Windows Role
            include_role:
              name: windows
            when: vars.os == "windows"

          - name: Send Email using Common Role
            include_role:
              name: common
              defaults_from: send_email.yml
              tasks_from: send_email.yml
      ```
      ---
      ***NOTE:** On task `Send Email using Common Role`, because there is no `main.yml` in either `common/defaults/` or `common/tasks/`, you need to specify which files to use through the `defaults_from` and `tasks_from` parameters.*

      ---

      We then run the caller playbook:
      ```shell
      ansible-playbook -i ~/ansible/custom_inventory.json -e 'affected_host="all"' ~/ansible/playbooks/ansible_roles.yml
      ```

      Output:
      ```

      ---
      ***NOTE:** Although it is possible to run a role directly using `ansible -m include_role -a name=<role_name>`, this is not advisable, especially when the role depends on values from other roles or playbooks. When using a caller playbook, you ensure that all dependencies for that role are met before it runs, and also ensures that its output variables are still available even after the role has finished its execution.*

  - ## 5.4 Ansible Galaxy
    - ### 5.4.1 Galaxy Website
      Ansible Galaxy (https://galaxy.ansible.com/) is a website for finding, downloading, and sharing community developed roles. It has thousands of solutions that can be freely imported to and used in your environment.

      Refer to the [Galaxy User Guide](<https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/galaxy/user_guide.html>) for more information on how you can use the roles and contribute to the community.

    - ### 5.4.2 The `ansible-galaxy` Command
      The `ansible-galaxy` command was created primarily for creating, configuring and managing roles in shared repositories (such as https:/ansible.galaxy.com), but it's also commonly used as a way to jumpstart the creation of local roles, since it automatically creates the directory structure needed for the role to run.

      To create a role called `new_role`, run the following commands in `controlserver`:
      ```shell
      [vagrant@localhost ~]$ cd ~/ansible/playbooks/roles/
      [vagrant@localhost roles]$ ansible-galaxy init --offline new_role
      ```

      Output:
      ```
      - new_role was created successfully
      [vagrant@localhost roles]$
      ```

      You can see that the new role structure has been automatically created for you:
      ```shell
      [vagrant@localhost ~]$ cd ~/ansible/playbooks/roles
      [vagrant@localhost roles]$ ls -laR new_role/
      new_role/:
